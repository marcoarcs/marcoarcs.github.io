    <h3 class="headlines">Early and middle life </h3>
    <p id="content">Born in 1922 to impoverished peasants in Azinhaga, Portugal, moved to Lisbon with his family in 1924. Despite hardships and familial tragedies, he pursued education and later worked as a mechanic. His love for reading grew as he frequented a public library in Lisbon. In 1944, he married Ilda Reis, and they had a daughter, Violante. Saramago's career included civil service, editing, translation, and journalism. In 1974, he became involved with the newspaper Diário de Notícias but was later fired due to political disputes.</p>
    <h3 class="headlines">Later life and International acclaim</h3>
    <p id="content">Recognition came later in life when, at the age of sixty, he published his fourth novel, "Memorial do Convento" in 1982. This baroque tale set during the Inquisition in 18th-century Lisbon revolves around the love between a maimed soldier and a young clairvoyant, as well as a renegade priest's heretical dream of flight. The novel, translated as "Baltasar and Blimunda" in 1988, introduced Saramago to an international audience and earned him the Portuguese PEN Club Award.</br>Saramago's literary acclaim continued to grow with novels like "The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis" and "The History of the Siege of Lisbon." His intricate yet elegant style, wide range of references, and wit endeared him to literary critics. "The History of the Siege of Lisbon" explores the uncertainty of historical events and delves into the story of a middle-aged proofreader who falls in love with his boss.</br>In 1986, Saramago met Pilar del Río, a Spanish intellectual and journalist, which led to the end of his long-standing partnership with Isabel Nóbrega. They married in 1988, remaining together until Saramago's passing in June 2010. Del Río became the official Spanish translator of Saramago's works.</br>Saramago was a member of the Portuguese Communist Party from 1969 until his death, and he openly identified as a pessimist. His views, particularly those expressed in "The Gospel According to Jesus Christ," stirred controversy in Portugal, leading to a clash with the Catholic community and conservative government, ultimately prompting his move to Lanzarote in the Canaries.</br>In 1998, Saramago was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his ability to use parables fueled by imagination, compassion, and irony to help us better grasp a complex reality.</br>Tragically, Saramago's expected appearance as the guest of honor at the European Writers' Parliament in 2010, a conference he co-authored, was never realized as he passed away before the event took place.</p>
    <h3 class="headlines">Death and Funeral</h3>
    <p id="content">José Saramago passed away on June 18, 2010, at the age of 87, in Lanzarote, Spain, where he had lived for his last years. He died suddenly after breakfast and a conversation with his wife, Pilar del Río. Saramago was celebrated as a prominent Portuguese writer and a committed Communist.</br>Margaret Jull Costa, his English language translator, praised his "wonderful imagination" and hailed him as "the greatest contemporary Portuguese writer." Saramago continued writing until his death, with his posthumous work, "Claraboia," published in 2011.</br>His death led to two days of mourning in Portugal and garnered tributes from international leaders, including Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Bernard Kouchner, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and the Castro brothers from Cuba.</br>Saramago's funeral in Lisbon drew over 20,000 mourners, but notably absent was the right-wing President of Portugal, Aníbal Cavaco Silva, who cited not knowing Saramago as his reason for not attending. Mourners held red carnations, symbolizing Portugal's democratic revolution.</br>Saramago's cremation took place in Lisbon, and his ashes found their final resting place beneath a century-old olive tree in front of the José Saramago Foundation on June 18, 2011, the anniversary of his death.</p>
